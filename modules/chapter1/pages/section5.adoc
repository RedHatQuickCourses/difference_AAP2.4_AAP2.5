= The Config as code

To automate your automation, use Ansible Playbooks to set up and maintain Ansible Automation Platform with fresh and updated material sets using collections. 

Employ a consistent gitops "as-code" methodology to supply platform configuration and automation material.

Certified collections for platform services configuration: 

- https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/ansible/hub/[ansible.hub]*: This Ansible collection allows for easy interaction with an Ansible Automation Hub server via Ansible playbooks.
- https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/ansible/eda/[Ansible.eda]: This collection is for Event Driven Ansible controller and contains event source plugins, event filters, and example rulebooks to be used with ansible-rulebook.
- https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/ansible/controller/[ansible.controller]: This Ansible collection allows for easy interaction with a Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform server via https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/rulebook/en/stable/[Ansible playbooks].

- https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/ansible/platform/[ansible.platform]*: This collection contains modules that can be used to automate the creation of resources on an installation of Ansible Automation Platform.
