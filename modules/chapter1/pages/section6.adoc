= The New Centralized Redis 

Ansible Automation Platform offers a centralized Redis instance in both standalone and clustered topologies. This enables resiliency by providing consistent performance and reliability. 	

*Standalone*

Standalone Redis consists of a simple architecture that is easy to deploy and configure.

If a resilient solution is not a requirement, deploy Ansible Automation Platform with a standalone Redis. 			

*Resilience Solutions* basically assists businesses in reducing risks. These solutions improve an organization's capacity to endure and bounce back from crises, reduce disruptions, and guarantee business continuity. Each step makes the following contributions:

*Clustered*

With clustered Redis, data is automatically partitioned over multiple nodes to provide performance stability and nodes are assigned as replicas to provide reliability. Clustered Redis shared between the platform gateway and Event-Driven Ansible is provided by default when installing Ansible Automation Platform in containerized and operator-based deployments.

The benefits of deploying clustered Redis over standalone Redis include the following: 			
Data is automatically split across multiple nodes. 					
Data can be dynamically adjusted. 					
Automatic failover of the primary nodes is initiated during system failures. 	

NOTE: Clustered Redis is shared between the platform gateway and Event-Driven Ansible and is provided by default when installing Ansible Automation Platform in containerized and operator-based deployments.
