... Hostname_gateway/
.... /api/gateway/
.... /api/controller/
.... /api/eda/
.... /api/galaxy/

. Authentication and authorization
. Role based access controls (RBAC)
.. Some User roles are now managed via Gateway API authentication
Yet Teams seem to be still managed via Controller API (old way)
.. Teams can now be Org admins. 
.. Org roles are managed from Orgs, not from Teams and Users
.. Ability to create custom role definitions
